# **Python Code Assistant**

## **Overview**
This project contains a Python script (`code_assistant.py`) that generates output files in an `output` folder. To streamline the workflow, a bash script (`run.sh`) automates the following tasks:  
1. Activates the virtual environment. 
2. Update the config file (Model and Key)
3. Paste the Problem Statement in "user_prompt.txt" file
3. Executes the `run.sh` file.  

## **Prerequisites**
Before running the automation script, ensure the following are installed on your system:  
- **Python** (3.10 or later)  
- **Git**  
- A virtual environment with all required dependencies installed (e.g., `venv`)
